# The Arux.net blog

Well, this isn't really a blog yet. I'm just walking through Avdi Grimm's
awesome [Objects on Rails](http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/11/15/early-access-beta-of-objects-on-rails-now-available-2/) book. So far the main difference is that I'm using rspec
instead of MiniTest. I'm more comfortable with RSpec's matchers, and it provides
a good exercise for writing the code myself.
